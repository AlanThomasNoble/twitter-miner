General Project Notes
(Updated project_notes file)

Tasks Todo...
> datavis.py
	/Helper Functions/
		- finish lemmmatizeText(), expandAbbr() (expandAbbr() may not be that useful)
		- test displayDataframe() function

	/Visuals Class/
		- Figure out how to save images to output WITHOUT parts of the image being cut out. (autofit options?)

		/editDataframe()/
			- subjectivity filtering (once columns are added)
		/freqGraph()/
			- generalize some code.
			- show user the maximum number of entries that they can use?
				-> if it is not a sentiment based...chart.
			- add pie chart?
				-> we can limit num entries for pie chart by writing this in user input() message for num.
		/polSub()/
			- Requires column additions to get # values for subjectivity and sentiment.
			- then, test.
		/analytics()/
			- eventually phase out and merge with valueCounts()
		/valueCounts()/
			- deal with `sizes = [v.positive, v.neutral, v.negative]` error when filtering tweets.
			- Requires column additions for subjectivity value counts.
