Level 4 autonomy is easier to deploy compared to Level 5 full autonomy. As vehicles can be remote-controlled, there's no risk for the driver. Unfortunately for #coronavirus epidemic these vehicles can not be utilized sufficiently, as most of them are still on prototype level.

retweet status: The code did indeed work, but it's been a while since I've had to tune it. I started with parameters from @diyrobocars, where a 2-meter error means you're way off the track. Here, the track is ~8m wide, so the first attempt resulted in it driving straight into the weeds.

retweet status: @EllerbachMaxime @SmallpixelCar @circuitlaunch @diyrobocars @NVIDIAEmbedded He's talking about this tool:
https://t.co/DIXbeMfCSe - you define a track by a series of circular arcs connected by straight lines, and then it can solve for a minimum-curvature loop within the track boundary constraints.

1020) 2020-02-23 15:07:25
retweet status: @a1k0n @circuitlaunch @diyrobocars @NVIDIAEmbedded Yes, I was able to run. After tied different tracks, I could generate a track in one hour. I also found you could not use more than 180 degree of a circle. Otherwise the program will not work...if you know what I am talking about.

account status: 7/7 Later this year, we‚Äôll share more on the safety framework we‚Äôve developed to ensure the safe performance of our self-driving technology as we continue to scale our fully driverless operations.

1840) 2020-02-26 20:09:17
account status: 6/7 We also expect our values to fluctuate depending on release timing, geography and other non-engineering reasons, which invalidates time-series comparisons.

1841) 2020-02-26 20:08:48
account status: 5/7 This is even more the case in 2019 and 2020, as we are now developing our 5th-generation Waymo Driver in Silicon Valley, SF and LA. We don't think CA disengagement data should be used to compare performance, or judge readiness or competency.

1842) 2020-02-26 20:07:59
account status: 4/7 This real-world production performance is largely unrelated to our California testing outputs. At this stage our real-world driving in California is predominately engineering development, and not production releases.

1843) 2020-02-26 20:07:29
account status: 3/7 Most of our large-scale real-world driving, which is critical for full-system validation (including validating the realism of our simulator) comes from Phoenix. Indeed, our production releases are already serving thousands of Waymo riders in Phoenix.

1844) 2020-02-26 20:06:09
account status: 2/7 While much of the development, learning, and validation of the Waymo Driver comes through billions of miles driven within our simulation environments, our real-world driving experience is primarily outside of California, in markets like Detroit and Phoenix.

1845) 2020-02-26 20:04:30
account status: 1/7 We appreciate what the California DMV was trying to do when creating this requirement, but the disengagement metric does not provide relevant insights into the capabilities of the Waymo Driver or distinguish its performance from others in the self-driving space.

I'll start.

Here our car yielded to bicyclists (who are behind a stop-line). We predicted that there was a chance they'd blow through it.

That was a little too conservative. https://t.co/0FtCVQU4KA
