"I predict the greatest innovations in machine learning &amp; computing technologies will be driven almost entirely by the autonomous driving sector."

https://t.co/supl4GZ3rz
531) The foundation of any ML system is data and at Cruise we have plenty of it. Pre-COVID-19, our fleet of 200+ AVs drove 24 hrs a day collecting huge amounts of data — petabytes per day. 

Here’s how we enable our teams to make the most of it.

But, the industry is facing challenges. We talked to @cademetz and the @nytimes about @voyage's plan to overcome them.

https://t.co/eRYXPiUS6t
956) 🚘 We are delighted to partner with @fcagroup to integrate our self-driving technology into purpose-built Chrysler Pacifica vehicles.

This is one of the last remaining puzzle pieces necessary to remove the Test Driver and launch fully driverless cars.

https://t.co/NAS8H3n2Yp
957) retweeted: ⁦⁦I am thrilled to share this news! ⁦@voyage⁩ is partnering with ⁦@fcagroup⁩ to deliver fully driverless cars 🚙 https://t.co/Re3c10c1RC
958) retweeted: 7️⃣ I am incredibly proud of our team for pulling this off. They showed the perseverance necessary to get a multi-hundred-day partnership deal over the finish line.

Also, a big thank you FCA for being great partners. We look forward to a fleet of thousands of your vehicles!
959) retweeted: 6️⃣ Since then, we’ve been hard at work with FCA's excellent engineers to integrate our self-driving technology into our new purpose-built Chrysler Pacifica mini-vans.

Their team has thought through every detail you could possibly imagine.

https://t.co/G624DHQVJk
960) retweeted: 5️⃣ Breakthrough! The stars aligned, and we signed our partnership with FCA on August 5th 2019.

This is a photo of me at FCA headquarters with a snazzy new hat.

That was a great day. The deal felt like @voyage punching above its weight, and we likely were. https://t.co/gKVmf3Pz89
961) retweeted: 4️⃣ In early 2019, deal fatigue began to creep in. Partnerships like this are not yet common-place.

However, we all kept on pushing and pushing hard (and kudos to FCA for being so excellent to work with). It involved a lot of flying and early morning presentations 💤 https://t.co/rFMifuY6By
962) retweeted: 3️⃣ We got our first signal that a partnership with FCA was theoretically possible in December 2018, and our COO (@ninaqi), ceremoniously shared this Bitmoji.

That said, we were still a _long_ way from getting this done, and accessing the vehicle we needed to enable driverless. https://t.co/t03Q3Czoew
963) retweeted: 2️⃣ Our self-driving technology needs access to the lowest-level systems within a vehicle. If a failure occurs, our software needs to react.

We also need braking and steering redundancies installed. If an actuator is compromised, our software needs to adapt and change its plan.
964) retweeted: 1️⃣ This story begins in September 2018 (618 days ago!)

To deliver a fully driverless car, if you’re not an auto-maker, you need a vehicle partnership.

Why?
965) retweeted: ⚡️ Big news from @voyage: we have partnered with @fcagroup to deliver fully driverless cars!

Our self-driving technology is now integrated into a purpose-built Chrysler Pacifica. This is one of the last steps to pull the Test Driver.
