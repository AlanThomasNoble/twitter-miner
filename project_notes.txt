Notes for the Twitter Miner

# API for locating a tweet once we have the tweet's id
# l = [1272276179064684545]
# print(api.statuses_lookup(l))
# return 0



Next steps - 

- Test run / Gather as many tweets as possible
- Determine how to output the information collected
- Determine ideal way to gather a massive amount of tweets. Look into other libraries to see if there are better ways to collect twitter information

Idea for test run
1) just get list of accounts 20 - 30 to get around 600 tweets
2) user search function -> obtain account ids -> pull tweets from those accounts
