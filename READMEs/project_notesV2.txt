General Project Notes
(Updated project_notes file)

Tasks Todo...
> datavis.py
	/General/
		- I think eventually we'll want to ideally remove all userInput apart from editDataframe() from this file.  
		- To do this, I think we'll need to do things.
			1) Automaticaly generate all possible visualizations w/o asking user.
			2) Add prints() to main.py to ask user for this function(), these are the additional parameters we'll need (i.e. num n for ngrams).  And, then these will be passed in the class and the function.
	/Helper Functions/
		- finish lemmmatizeText(), expandAbbr() (expandAbbr() may not be that useful)
		- test displayDataframe() function
		- add handleMiddleAbbreviation() function (i.e. -, ...)

	/Visuals Class/
		- Figure out how to save images to output WITHOUT parts of the image being cut out. (autofit options?)

		/editDataframe()/
			- subjectivity filtering (once columns are added)
		/polSub()/
			- tested, requires column addition, and then update referenced name for self.df
		/valueCounts()/
			- Requires column additions for subjectivity value counts.

> twitter_miner1.py
	- nothing major, mostly cleanup stuff if anything
	- adding columns
	- merging json writing code to getInfo()?

Next Steps...
> More Visualizations
	- any ideas?
