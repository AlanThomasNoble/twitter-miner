Notes for the Twitter Miner

# API for locating a tweet once we have the tweet's id
# l = [1272276179064684545]
# print(api.statuses_lookup(l))
# return 0



Next steps...
- Test run -> Gather as many tweets as possible
- Determine how to output the information collected (Json)
- Determine ideal way to gather a massive amount of tweets. Look into other libraries to see if there are better ways to collect twitter information

Idea for test run

Based around account search function: obtain_tweets_from_list_users(api)
1) just get list of accounts 30-40 to get around 800 tweets ->almost done
2) user search function(function for obtaining users related to autonomous vehicles) -> obtain account ids -> pull tweets from those accounts

Based on search query function: obtain_tweets_from_search(api)
1) List of keywords
2) Generate up to 100 tweets for each keyword (30 keywords -> 3000 tweets)


Pros -
We can get a list of around 800 tweets

Cons -
The full tweet is not displayed
